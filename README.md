Planning Questions:

Who is your target audience?
Singles in the DC Metro Area looking for exciting activities.

What is the problem that the product will address?
Boredom and last minute planning.

What is the primary goal of the product?
Making cool events faster and easier to find, and helping people decide what to do.

Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
1- As a user, I want to take a quick quiz and see all the choices to help me find something to do.

2- As a user, I want to view all the important information about each event in one place so I can pick one easily, and so I'll be prepared when I get there.

3- As a Metro area resident, I want to know how to get there using metro.

(Broad user story for entire app- "As a busy young professional in the DC area, I have trouble keeping track of everything happening and usually end up stuck when making plans with friends because none of us knows what we want to do. I need something that finds out what's happening near us without cluttering the results with events we wouldn't want to attend and that makes it easy to make a decision, especially last-minute. I also want to have all the information in one place to attend the event, including the nearest Metro station.")
